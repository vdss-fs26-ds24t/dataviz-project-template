![The vizualization product development process](pics/vizproductprocess.png){#fig-vizprocess}

The methodological procedure of this work follows the process model shown in @fig-vizprocess, which is based on the concepts on data product development outlined in @DoemerKempf2022_1000150238 and the [data science project-template](https://github.com/phonosync/dataviz-project-template) on github.

It comprises the following four main phases with the corresponding documentation artefacts:

* **Project Understanding** &rarr; [Project Charta](project_charta.qmd): Fundamental analysis of the users and their characteristics, the tasks to be supported, formulation of the goals, success criteria and constraints.
* **Data Acquisition and Exploration** &rarr; [Data Report](data_report.qmd): Identification and acquisition of relevant data sources, followed by exploratory data analysis to understand data quality and structure.
* **Visual Encoding and Design** &rarr; [Design Description](viz_encoding_design.qmd): Description of the visual encoding and design decisions made for the data visualization product/prototyp.
* **Evaluation** &rarr; [Evaluation Report](evaluation.qmd): Assessment of the developed prototype based on success criteria outlined in the project charta, evaluation of stakeholder feedback, checkpoint decision and, if applicable, gathering additional requirements and planning of the deployment.
* **Deployment** &rarr; [Deployment Report](deployment.qmd): Description of the software architecture and deployment process, as well as the integration of the visualization product into the target environment and processes.
